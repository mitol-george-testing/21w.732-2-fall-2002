  "course_description": "An information-based society necessitates good writing in all careers.\n\nMany scientists and technical professionals must write progress reports, analyses, literature reviews, or other documents to communicate within their workplaces, and many must also address more general audiences in grant proposals, conference papers, articles, and so on. This course is designed to serve as a basic introduction to the practice of technical writing for those who work as scientists and technical researchers.\n\nBecause scientific and technical fields are becoming more interdisciplinary and more globally connected everyday, we will also consider intercultural communication issues at some length.\n",
